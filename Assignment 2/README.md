### Task 1 – UI Fix (10 pts)

This repository contains comprehensive solutions for all the mobile layout issues and registration button problems identified in the tech assessment.

## 🚀 Implemented Solutions

### 1. Mobile Layout Issues Fixed

#### **Text Overlap Issue**
- **Problem**: Content was overlapping due to fixed widths
- **Solution**: 
  - Used `width: 100%` and `max-width` properties throughout the CSS
  - Implemented proper box-sizing with `box-sizing: border-box`
  - Added responsive container classes with max-width constraints
  - All form inputs now use `width: 100%` to prevent overflow

#### **Navigation Overflow Issue**
- **Problem**: Menu not responsive, causing overflow on mobile devices
- **Solution**: 
  - Implemented a hamburger menu using pure CSS and JavaScript
  - Added responsive navigation that collapses on mobile devices
  - Menu transforms into a vertical dropdown below 768px screen width
  - Added smooth animations for menu transitions
  - Implemented click-outside-to-close functionality

#### **Unaligned CTA Button**
- **Problem**: CTA button was not properly aligned
- **Solution**: 
  - Used Flexbox for proper alignment with `.cta-container`
  - Centered the button using `justify-content: center`
  - Made button responsive with `width: 100%` and `max-width: 250px`
  - Added proper spacing and padding for different screen sizes

### 2. Non-working Registration Button Fixed

#### **Root Causes Identified & Fixed**

1. **Missing Form Action**
   - Added proper form action attribute: `action="/register"`
   - Implemented proper form method: `method="POST"`

2. **JavaScript Errors**
   - Added comprehensive error handling in form submission
   - Implemented proper event listeners with `addEventListener`
